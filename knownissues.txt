  Eg. Connection OpenAI: [PASS]
  Eg. Connection EODHD: [FAIL]

ISSUE#02: /get_sentiment is capable of taking US market enquiry but not other region due to EODHD API accept in such format {symbol}.{region} and got JSON syntax error if pass along the dot. Update all other functions in the Python code too

ISSUE#03: Right before displaying sendMessage() result Stock Sentiment Score: AMD: 1.0 in Telegram. The flow of Telegram message must show title of headlines in between each thread descending chronological order. It is wrong to jump to conclusion straightaway in user mode when interacts with the Bot

  Eg. YYMMDD-HHMM: Headline Title1
  Eg. YYMMDD-HHMM: Headline Title2
  Eg. YYMMDD-HHMM: Headline Title3
